It's a simmering bowl of savory deliciousness!
<br>Course: Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese, Korean
<br>Keyword: gyoza, hotpot
<br>Servings: 2
<br>Calories: 201 kcal
<br>Prep Time - 10 mins
<br>Cook Time - 30 mins

 Ingredients
 
<br>•	¼ onion
<br>•	1 negi (long green onion)
<br>•	4-6 leaves napa cabbage
<br>•	1-2 inch daikon radish
<br>•	2 inch carrot
<br>•	5 stalks chives
<br>•	1 pack shimeji mushrooms (3.5 oz, 100 g)
<br>•	2 shiitake mushrooms
<br>•	7 oz silken/soft tofu (½ block)
<br>•	2 tsp sesame oil (roasted)
<br>•	10 pieces gyoza (I used frozen gyoza; for homemade gyoza recipe, you can click here)
<br>For Hot Pot Soup
<br>•	1 cup kimchi (for vegan kimchi, you can make my friend Seonkyoung's recipe)
<br>•	1 Tbsp sake
<br>•	2 tsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)
<br>•	1 tsp gochugaru (Korean pepper flakes)
<br>•	2 tsp sugar
<br>•	4 cups chicken stock/broth (use kombu dashi or shiitake dashi for vegan/vegetarian)
<br>•	2 tsp soy sauce
<br>•	2 Tbsp miso
<br>•	¼ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)

<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients and cut ¼ onion into wedges and then cut them half. Cut the white part of negi (leek/green onion) diagonally.
<br>2.	Cut the napa cabbage into small pieces and cut the daikon into quarters lengthwise then thinly slice them.
<br>3.	Cut the carrot into thin slabs and cut them in half and cut the garlic chives into 2-inch (5 cm) pieces.
<br>4.	Discard the bottom of the shimeji mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms. You can make a decorative shiitake mushroom following this method.
<br>5.	Cut the tofu into roughly 1.5-inch (4 cm) cubes (it’s harder to fish out from the hot pot if you cut too small).
<br>6.	Heat the sesame oil in a hot pot over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until it’s coated with the oil.
<br>7.	Add the kimchi and stir fry with the onion and Tokyo negi and add sake and gochujang.
<br>8.	Add gochugaru and granulated sugar. Mix all together well and add 4 cups chicken stock and cover the lid to bring to simmer.
<br>9.	Once simmering, lower the heat to medium-low heat. Add soy sauce and miso. It’s best to put miso and small amount of soup in a ladle and let it dissolve first instead of dropping miso in a pot and not sure if it has been dissolved completely. Taste the soup and adjust the taste by adding salt (I added ¼ to ½ tsp), if necessary.
<br>10.	Add the hard vegetables to the soup first, such daikon, carrot, tough part of napa cabbages, etc. Cook covered for 10 minutes on low heat.
<br>11.	Skim off the foam and fat. Add the soft ingredients such as leafy part of napa cabbages, mushrooms, and tofu.
<br>12.	Add the gyoza (if frozen, no need to defrost) and garlic chives on top.
<br>13.	Cook covered over medium low heat for 5 minutes. Serve the extra ingredients on a plate and add them once you finish the ingredients in the pot.

<br>Cuisine: Japanese

 Ingredients
 
<br>•	2 servings udon noodles (180 g dry udon noodles; 500 g frozen/boiled udon noodles; udon is served at the end of the meal after all the ingredients are cooked and the broth is left in the pot.)
<br>•	½ head napa cabbage (10 leaves; 1.8 oz or 690 g)
<br>•	½ bunch shungiku (tong ho/garland chrysanthemum) (7 oz, 200 g)
<br>•	1 negi (long green onion) (1 leek, 3 green onions)
<br>•	1 package enoki mushrooms (7 oz, 200 g)
<br>•	8 shiitake mushrooms (or other kinds of mushrooms)
<br>•	1 package Yaki Tofu (Broiled Tofu) (9 oz, 255 g)
<br>•	⅓ carrot (optional)
<br>•	1 package shirataki noodles (7 oz, 198 g; or cellophane noodles, yam noodles)
<br>•	1 lb thinly sliced beef (chuck or rib eye) (slice your own meat)
<br>To Cook Sukiyaki
<br>•	1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc) (or beef fat if your sukiyaki beef package comes with it)
<br>•	1 Tbsp brown sugar (we use it for the first batch of meat)
<br>•	1-1.5 cup dashi (Japanese soup stock; click to learn more) (or water; to dilute the sauce)
<br>Sukiyaki Sauce (Yield 2 ⅔ cup)
<br>•	1 cup sake
<br>•	1 cup mirin
<br>•	¼ cup sugar
<br>•	1 cup soy sauce



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients.
<br>To Make Sukiyaki Sauce
<br>1.	Combine 1 cup sake, 1 cup mirin, ¼ cup sugar, and 1 cup soy sauce in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Once boiling, turn off the heat and set aside. This Sukiyaki sauce can be stored in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for up to a month.
<br>To Prepare the Ingredients
<br>1.	If your udon is frozen, cook it in boiling water until loosen. Remove from heat and soak in iced water to prevent overcooking them. Drain and transfer to a plate covered with plastic. You will not need it till the end of the sukiyaki meal.
<br>2.	Prepare sukiyaki ingredients. Cut napa cabbage into 2” (5 cm) wide then cut in half right at the middle of the white part.
<br>3.	Cut shungiku into 2” (5 cm) wide, and slice Tokyo negi. Discard the bottom part of enoki and tear into smaller bundles.
<br>4.	Discard the shiitake stem and decorate the top of shiitake if you like and cut tofu into smaller pieces (I usually cut into 6-8 pieces).
<br>5.	If you like, you can slice some carrots and then stamp them into a floral shape for decoration.
<br>6.	Drain and rinse the shirataki noodles (sorry no photo). Put all the ingredients on one big platter for the table or into smaller individual servings.
<br>To Cook Sukiyaki
<br>1.	Set a portable gas cooktop at the dining table. Each person should have a medium-sized bowl where the cooked food is being transferred to from the pot. Heat a cast iron sukiyaki pot (or any pot) on medium heat. When it’s hot, add 1 Tbsp cooking oil (or beef fat).
<br>2.	Place 2-4 slices of well-marbled beef to sear and sprinkle 1 Tbsp brown sugar. Flip and cook the other side of the meat. You can pour a little bit of Sukiyaki Sauce over the meat and enjoy some (or all) of the sweet and nicely caramelized meat now (this is to enjoy the good quality meat), and continue to the next step.
<br>The First Round of Sukiyaki
<br>1.	Pour half of the Sukiyaki Sauce you made (1 ⅓ cup) and 1 cup dashi (or water) in the pot.
<br>2.	Add vegetables, tofu, and other ingredients to the pot (keep the udon for later). Add more Sukiyaki Sauce or dashi (or water) if necessary. 
<br>3.	The ⅔ of the ingredients should be submerged in the broth. Put the lid on and bring to a gentle boil. 
<br>4.	Once boiling, turn down the heat and simmer until the ingredients are cooked through. Once ingredients are cooked through, you can add more beef as beef will cook fast. Enjoy the first round of sukiyaki. If the sauce gets too salty (from evaporating), add dashi (or water) to dilute. If the vegetables diluted the sauce too much, then add more sukiyaki sauce.
<br>The Second/Third Round of Sukiyaki (Optional)
<br>1.	When there is less cooked food in the pot, divide the leftover into individual bowls. Then start cooking the second round by adding more ingredients to the pot (repeat the previous step). While the second round of sukiyaki is being cooked, you can enjoy the leftover from the first pot or any side dishes.
<br>To End the Meal
<br>1.	We usually end the sukiyaki meal with udon. When most of the ingredients have disappeared, add udon to the pot. Cook until heated through and enjoy.

This well-balanced meal is traditionally eaten by sumo wrestlers but also enjoyed at home or some restaurants. 
<br>Course: Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: hot pot
<br>Servings: 6
<br>Prep Time - 45 mins
<br>Cook Time - 15 mins
<br>Total Time - 1 hr


 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>For the broth:
<br>•	6 cups chicken broth
<br>•	¼ cup sake (4 Tbsp)
<br>•	⅓ cup mirin
<br>•	2 Tbsp ginger juice (use grater and squeeze grated ginger to get the juice; See Notes)
<br>•	1 ½ tsp crushed garlic
<br>•	½ cup miso (preferably white miso; 8 Tbsp)
<br>For the chicken meatballs:
<br>•	½ lb ground chicken
<br>•	1 large egg (50 g w/o shell) (beaten and halved)
<br>•	2 tsp ginger juice
<br>•	2 tsp soy sauce
<br>•	1 Tbsp cornstarch
<br>•	6 Tbsp panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)
<br>•	3 Tbsp green onions/scallions (finely chopped)
<br>For the stew:
<br>•	chicken meatballs (follow instructions)
<br>•	1 ½ lb cod fillet
<br>•	8 shrimp
<br>•	6 oz sliced pork belly
<br>•	4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
<br>•	14 oz medium-firm tofu (1 package)
<br>•	½ head napa cabbage
<br>•	2 negi (long green onion)
<br>•	6 green onions/scallions
<br>•	4-6 shiitake mushrooms
<br>•	¼ carrot (for decoration; sliced and cut out with a vegetable cutter)
<br>For serving:
<br>•	ponzu (for my homemade ponzu recipe, click here)
<br>•	sesame sauce
<br>•	2-3 cups cooked Japanese short-grain rice (alternatively, you can serve udon noodles)



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>To make the broth:
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients for Chanko Nabe Broth.
<br>2.	To make the broth, in a Dutch oven or other large pot over medium heat, combine the broth, sake, mirin, ginger juice, and garlic and bring to a simmer.
<br>3.	Spoon several spoonfuls of broth into a small bowl, add the miso, and stir until smooth.
<br>4.	Gradually add the miso mixture to the broth in the pot, stirring to avoid lumps. Once the miso has been incorporated, do not let the broth boil.
<br>To make the chicken meatballs:
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients. This grater (I have 6" one) works great for grating ginger (daikon, garlic, etc) and keeping the juice from grating it. In this recipe, we only use ginger juice. 
<br>2.	In a large bowl, combine the chicken, ½ beaten egg (reserve the remaining egg for another use), the ginger juice, soy sauce, corn starch, panko, and green onion. Using your hands, mix all together.
<br>3.	Once the mixture becomes a little bit white and well combined, shape the mixture into a ball. Sprinkle with panko as needed.
<br>To cut all the ingredients:
<br>1.	Cut the cod fillet into 2-inch chunks, peel and devein shrimp, cut the sliced pork belly into 2-inch pieces, trim the visible fat from the chicken thighs and cut into bite-sized pieces, cut the tofu into 1-inch cubes, and separate the leaves from napa cabbage and cut them into smaller pieces. Slice the carrot and cut out with a flower-shaped vegetable cutter.
<br>2.	Cut negi (long green onion) diagonally into 1-inch-thick pieces, cut the green onions into 2-inch lengths, and remove stems of shiitake mushrooms and make a decorative cut on the caps if desired.
<br>To set up the table:
<br>1.	To prepare the stew ingredients, place the meatballs, seafood, pork belly, chicken, tofu, carrot slices, napa cabbage, long green onion, green onions, and mushrooms on the platter.
<br>2.	Pour the ponzu sauce and sesame sauce (goma dare) into individual dipping bowls at each place setting along with chopsticks, a soup spoon (optional) and a soup bowl.
<br>3.	Place a portable gas burner and the nabe, and the stew ingredients on the table. If you don’t have a gas/electric burner, you can cook the stew on the stovetop, transfer it to a large bowl, and serve it family style.
<br>To cook Chanko Nabe:
<br>1.	If cooking the stew ingredients on the stovetop, cook in batches. Add some of each of the ingredients to the broth, simmer (do not boil) until cooked, and serve them, returning to the stove to start a new batch as each previous batch is eaten. The vegetables and tofu cook more quickly than the meatballs, seafood, and chicken.
<br>2.	Keep the broth at a simmer the entire time. If the liquid gets low, add a little water or chicken broth to have enough liquid to heat the noodles or rice at the end (even though you are thinning the broth, the flavorful ingredients you are cooking in it continue to enrich it).
<br>3.	When diners are ready, remove any solids in the broth and add the noodles or rice. Simmer until heated through, then ladle into the soup bowls and serve.

Seared in a cast iron pot, then roasted in the oven, this juicy, moist, tender pork is cooked to perfection in Japanese seasoning.
<br>Course: Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: juicy pork, pork roast
<br>Servings: 4
<br>Prep Time - 15 mins
<br>Cook Time - 1 hr
<br>Total Time - 1 hr 15 mins



 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	2 stalks celery
<br>•	2 carrots
<br>•	½ onion
<br>•	4 cloves garlic
<br>•	1.5-2 lb boneless pork sirloin (or center-cut pork loin; at room temperature)
<br>•	½ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)
<br>•	freshly ground black pepper
<br>•	2 Tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
<br>Seasonings
<br>•	4 Tbsp sake (I use Sho Chiku Bai)
<br>•	4 Tbsp mirin (I use Takara Mirin)
<br>•	1 tsp brown sugar
<br>•	3 Tbsp soy sauce (Use GF soy sauce for gluten-free)



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Preheat oven to 350ºF (180ºC). For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Gather all the ingredients. Make sure to take the pork out of the refrigerator about 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Room temperature meat cooks more evenly throughout.
<br>2.	Chop the celery and carrot into small pieces and dice the onion. Smash the garlic with the side of the knife.
<br>3.	Dry the pork with paper towel and season all sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
<br>4.	Heat a large Dutch oven or cast-iron skillet on medium heat. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil and sear the pork on all sides until a crust forms, about 2 minutes per side. Remove the pork from the pan and set it aside.
<br>5.	Lower the heat to medium low, and add a little bit of olive oil if necessary. Sauté the onion and garlic until fragrant and slightly soften.
<br>6.	Then add the celery and carrot.
<br>7.	When the vegetables are well-coated with oil, add 4 Tbsp sake and scrape off the juicy brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.
<br>8.	Add 4 Tbsp mirin, 1 tsp brown sugar, and 3 Tbsp soy sauce and mix all together and place the pork back in the skillet and spoon some sauce over the pork.
<br>9.	Cover the pork with the oven-safe lid or aluminum foil and roast for 30-40 minutes (30 mins for 1 ½ lb and 40 mins for 2 lb), or until the pork interior temperature reaches about 145ºF (63ºC).
<br>10.	Remove the Dutch oven from the oven and transfer the pork to a plate. Cover the pork with foil to keep the moisture and let it rest for about 15 minutes.
<br>11.	Meanwhile, heat the Dutch oven on medium-low heat. Skim off any foam or scums. Simmer, stirring often, until the sauce has thickened to your preferred thickness.
<br>12.	 Once the sauce is reduced, the saltiness and flavors will concentrate so adjust how far you want to reduce. Slice the pork against the grain and serve hot with the sauce.

All you need are four ingredients to make this traditional rustic dish.
<br>Course: Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: seafood, yellowtail
<br>Servings: 1
<br>Prep Time - 5 mins
<br>Cook Time - 10 mins
<br>Total Time - 15 mins


 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	2 pieces Hamachi Kama (11 oz or 312 g; available in Japanese markets)
<br>•	⅛ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt) (optional; if you plan to lightly dip your fish in yuzu-flavored soy sauce, you can omit sprinkling salt)
<br>To Serve
<br>•	1 Tbsp soy sauce
<br>•	½ tsp Yuzu juice/Yuzu extract
<br>•	1 wedge lemon (optional)


<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather Ingredients. If hamachi kama is frozen, thaw beforehand by placing fish (still in vacuum-sealed package) in a bowl under a thin stream of cold, running water (20 minutes). Alternatively, you can put fish in a bowl of iced water to defrost (2 hours - but saves water), or in the refrigerator (9 hours).
<br>To Broil (Recommended)
<br>1.	Preheat the broiler* with a rack placed about 6" (15 cm) away from the top heating element (in the center of the oven) for 5 minutes. 
<br>2.	When broiling, you don't control the temperature in the oven; instead, you control the distance between the broiler and the surface of the food. It's similar to using hotter and cooler zones on your grill. *Broiler setting: Low (450ºF/232ºC), Medium (500ºF/260ºC), and High (550ºF/288ºC). I usually use medium (6" away) or high (8" away).
<br>3.	Crinkle a sheet of aluminum foil and line the baking sheet and place the Hamachi Kama on the foil, skin side down. Sprinkle salt over the fish.
<br>4.	Broil medium (500ºF) for 8-10 minutes until the surface is blistered and brown a bit. Please remember the cooking time varies depending on the thickness of the fish and the distance between the broiler and the food. You do not need to flip the fish. You do not need to flip it. It should flake easily with chopsticks or a fork.
<br>To Serve
<br>1.	Mix soy sauce and yuzu juice/extract together in a small dish, and serve immediately with the fish and optional lemon wedge. Squeeze lemon over the fish and dip Hamachi Kama lightly in the sauce to eat. Enjoy!

You'd love this simple yakitori recipe. It's great for grilling outdoor or under the broiler!
<br>Course: Appetizer, Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: bbq chicken, on a stick
<br>Servings: 10 Yakitori Skewers
<br>Prep Time - 30 mins
<br>Cook Time - 45 mins
<br>Total Time - 1 hr 15 mins



 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (at room temperature)
<br>•	9 green onions/scallions
<br>•	neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
<br>Yakitori Sauce (Tare):
<br>•	½ cup soy sauce
<br>•	½ cup mirin
<br>•	¼ cup sake
<br>•	¼ cup water
<br>•	2 tsp brown sugar (pack tighly and level off)




<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients and soak about 10 to 12 (5-inch) bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.
<br>To Make Yakitori Sauce (Tare)
<br>1.	In a small saucepan, add mirin, soy sauce, sake, water, brown sugar, and the green part of 1 scallion, and bring it to a boil over high heat. 
<br>2.	Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by half. It will take about 30 minutes. The sauce will thicken with a glossy shine. 
<br>3.	Let it cool to room temperature before using. Reserve ⅓ of the sauce in a small bowl for final coating (Use this sauce after the chicken is cooked). Note: You can make the sauce ahead of time. Put only the sauce (no green onion) in a mason jar. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 months in the refrigerator.
<br>To Prepare Yakitori
<br>1.	Cut the white and light green part of scallions into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces and cut chicken into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes.
<br>2.	On a flat work surface, fold each slice of chicken in half, insert into the chicken at 45 degrees angle, and press down on the skewer to pierce through the center.
<br>3.	Alternate each chicken slice with a piece of scallion lined up perpendicular to the skewer. Each skewer will hold about 4 chicken slices and 3 scallion pieces.
<br>To Grill (Broil) Yakitori
<br>1.	Grease the grate of the broiler/wire rack (or oven-safe cooling rack) to avoid the chicken sticking on the grate. Place the skewers on top.
<br>2.	Set the broiler to high and wait until the heating elements are hot. Broil for 6 minutes.
<br>3.	Take out 2 Tbsp of the Yakitori Sauce in a small bowl for brushing (you do not want to cross contaminate). After 6 minutes, brush the sauce on the meat on both sides and continue to broil for 3-4 minutes to caramelize the sauce.
<br>4.	Transfer the skewers to a serving plate. Using a clean brush, brush the chicken on top with the reserved sauce. Tip: If you accidentally cross-contaminate (Dip the brush you used for coating the raw chicken in the sauce), you have to boil the sauce again. Serve and enjoy!

Serve over steamed rice and drizzle extra miso sauce on top!
<br>Course: Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: miso, miso chicken, miso sauce
<br>Servings: 5
<br>Prep Time - 10 mins
<br>Cook Time - 15 mins
<br>Marinating - 1 day
<br>Total Time - 1 day 25 mins



 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	5 boneless, skin-on chicken thighs
<br>•	5 Tbsp all-purpose miso sauce (1 Tbsp for each chicken thigh)
<br>•	1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc) (for cooking)
<br>For Drizzling Sauce (for one chicken thigh)
<br>•	1 Tbsp all-purpose miso sauce
<br>•	1 Tbsp water
<br>For Toppings
<br>•	1 tsp toasted white sesame seeds
<br>•	1 green onion/scallion (chopped)


<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients.
<br>The 24 hours Before Cooking
<br>1.	Using the tip of the knife, prick the chicken skin so the fat can render more easily. Thoroughly pat the chicken dry and place it in the plastic bag.
<br>2.	Add the all-purpose miso sauce, remove the air, and zip up the plastic bag.
<br>3.	Rub the chicken well from outside the bag so the miso sauce is distributed evenly. Store in the refrigerator for 24 hours.
<br>The Day of Cooking
<br>1.	Take out the chicken from the plastic wrap (I’ll be cooking two), removing the miso sauce as much as possible with your hands (and discard this miso sauce). Using a paper towel, remove the miso as much as possible and make sure the chicken is completely dry. Set aside.
<br>2.	In a large frying pan, add 1 Tbsp oil and distribute evenly. Don’t turn on the heat yet.
<br>3.	Place the chicken skin-side down. Do not crowd the pan, and make sure there is some space in between so the chicken won’t end up being steamed.
<br>4.	Turn on the heat to medium-low to medium heat. Slowly cook the skin so the fat will render. DO NOT TOUCH the chicken for the next 7 minutes, except for occasionally pressing down with a spatula. Do not cover with a lid, but you can use a mesh splatter guard to avoid oil splatter. 
<br>5.	Slowly peek to see the skin is nicely browned and the edges of the chicken turn opaque. If so, flip and continue to cook the other side, for about 5 minutes. If not, continue to cook undisturbed for a little longer until well-browned. You can wipe off the oil that is rendered from the skin. Continue to press down occasionally to get the surface nicely seared.
<br>6.	Once both sides are nicely browned, remove from the pan and place the chicken on the cutting board until slightly cool for you to handle. If you have an instant-read thermometer, the safe temperature for chicken 165ºF (74ºC).  
<br>7.	To make the Drizzling Sauce, quickly wipe off the oil in the frying pan with a paper towel and add the miso sauce. For 1 chicken thigh, you need 1 Tbsp all-purpose miso sauce and 1 Tbsp water. Bring the sauce to simmer and once thicken, turn off the heat.

This Chicken Karaage with Sweet Chili Sauce is bite-size chicken thighs deep-fried to a golden brown and coated in a delightful sweet chili sauce. You'd be bowled over by this sweet and spicy version of Japanese fried chicken. 
<br>Course: Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: karaage, sweet chili sauce
Servings: 3
<br>Prep Time - 15 mins
<br>Cook Time - 30 mins
<br>Total Time - 45 mins


 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (roughly 4 pieces)
<br>•	2 Tbsp sake
<br>•	2 Tbsp soy sauce
<br>•	1 knob ginger
<br>•	1 cup potato starch/cornstarch (more or less)
<br>•	3 cups neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc) (for deep frying)
<br>•	2 green onions/scallions
<br>•	¼ cup cilantro



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients.
<br>2.	Remove and discard extra fat and skin, and cut each skin-on chicken thigh into 5 to 6 pieces, about 1 ½ inch (4 cm) pieces.
<br>3.	Peel the ginger skin and grate it. Cut the green onion/scallions and cilantro into small pieces.
<br>4.	In a medium bowl, combine sake, soy sauce and grated ginger, and add the chicken pieces to marinate. Keep in the fridge for 30 minutes. Tip: You may have noticed already but in Japanese cooking, common marinade time is between 20 and 30 minutes to preserve the ingredient’s original taste.
<br>5.	In the tray or bowl, prepare corn starch/potato starch. In a medium pot (update: I use this Staub 2.75QT for deep frying), heat the oil to 340ºF (170ºC). Use a thermometer or wooden chopsticks to see if the oil is ready (See How to Deep Fry Foods). Tip: You put a chopstick in the oil and when you see the bubbles around it, it’s ready!
<br>6.	When the oil is hot, drain the chicken well from the marinade and coat each piece with the corn/potato starch. Make sure the chicken is all covered by the starch so when you put the chicken into the oil, it won’t splatter.
<br>7.	Slowly place 4-6 chicken into the wok (Work with a few pieces at a time, so the oil temperature won’t drop quickly). Deep fry the chicken for 90 seconds, or until the chicken is light golden color. 
<br>8.	Transfer the chicken to a wire rack or paper towel to drain excess oil. Let the chicken cook with remaining heat while you work on the rest of chicken.
<br>9.	Once the chicken is all deep fried for the first round, use a fine mesh sieve to pick up crumbs to keep the oil clean.  If you don't do this step, the crumbs get darker and then the oil gets darker. 
<br>10.	Increase the heat and bring the oil to 350ºF (180ºC). Deep fry the chicken for the second time for 45 seconds or until crispy and golden brown.
<br>11.	Transfer the chicken to a wire rack to drain excess oil and in a frying pan, combine the sauce ingredients. Add green onion and cilantro and mix over medium heat.
<br>12.	When the sauce is bubbling, add the chicken and quickly coat well with the sauce. Don’t leave in the pan for no more than 15 seconds. Transfer to a serving plate.

Crispy on the outside and naturally sweet and savory on the inside, it's like a party in your mouth! These croquettes will disappear in no time.
<br>Course: Appetizer, Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: kabocha, korokke, pumpkin
<br>Servings: 15 croquettes
<br>Prep Time - 15 mins
<br>Cook Time - 30 mins
<br>Total Time - 45 mins

 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	1 ½ lb kabocha (squash/pumpkin) (½ kabocha with seeds)
<br>•	3 slices bacon
<br>•	½ onion (3 oz, 85 g)
<br>•	½ Tbsp unsalted butter
<br>•	½ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)
<br>•	⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper
<br>•	3 cups neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
<br>For Breading
<br>•	¼ cup all-purpose flour (plain flour)
<br>•	1 large egg (50 g w/o shell)
<br>•	½ cup panko (Japanese breadcrumbs)



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients.
<br>2.	Remove seeds and pith from the kabocha and cut into big chunks, about 2 inch (5 cm) pieces.
<br>3.	Set up the steamer (I use this steamer basket inside the dutch oven here). Steam kabocha for 20 minutes or until tender (enough that you can mash with fork) but don’t overcook.
<br>4.	While steaming the kabocha, mince the onion. Slice parallel to the grain, slice against the grain (image 1), cut into cubes (image 2), and chop into even smaller pieces (image 3).
<br>5.	Cut the bacon into small bits. For better texture, I like the bacon to be about ¼ inches (6 mm).
<br>6.	Heat the butter in a large frying pan over medium heat. Add the onion and saute for 2-3 minutes, and add the bacon. Cook until the onion is translucent, tender, and nicely brown. Set aside until the kabocha is done with steaming.
<br>7.	Remove the kabocha from the pot and let cool until you can touch (but still warm). Remove the skin using a knife or spoon. Kabocha skin is edible and you don’t have to remove it. However, your kabocha croquette will be dark in color instead of a bright orange color.
<br>8.	Transfer all the kabocha in a large bowl and mash with a fork.
<br>9.	Add the onion and bacon mixture to the mashed kabocha. Try to avoid adding excess oil, which could make the mixture too wet. Season with ½ tsp salt and ⅛ tsp freshly ground black pepper.
<br>10.	Combine well together. Using a cookie scoop, make it into ball shape. I can usually make 15-18 balls with ½ kabocha (1.5 lbs with seeds).
<br>11.	Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes to kabocha balls become firmer and add 1 Tbsp water to the beaten egg. Coat kabocha balls in flour.
<br>12.	Then coat with egg mixture, and finally panko.
<br>13.	Cover with plastic wrap and rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. During this time, the flour absorbs moisture. As a result, it’ll be less splatter in oil and the batter becomes sticker and won’t come off while deep frying. Also, if you deep fry the food when it's still warm, the steam inside the filling will get hot and try to escape, which will end up exploding in the hot oil.
<br>14.	When it’s almost 30 minutes, start heating up the oil to 340ºF (170ºC) in a pot. Insert the long chopsticks, and when you see small bubbles appear around them, it’s ready to deep fry the croquette. The filling of the croquette is cooked already, so all you need is to fry the coating until golden brown.
<br>15.	Transfer golden kabocha croquette to a wire rack or a plate lined with paper towel. Sprinkle some salt such as sea salt or Himalayan pink salt.
