 <br><br>
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	4 ounces chicken breast
<br>•	(115g, finely chopped)
<br>•	1 tablespoon water
<br>•	1 teaspoon cornstarch
<br>•	1 teaspoon oyster sauce
<br>•	1½ cups fresh or frozen sweet corn
<br>•	5 cups chicken stock (organic or homemade preferred)
<br>•	½ teaspoon turmeric powder
<br>•	½ teaspoon sesame oil
<br>•	½ teaspoon salt (or to taste)
<br>•	1 pinch white pepper
<br>•	1/4 cup cornstarch (combined with ½ cup chicken stock)
<br>•	2 egg whites (lightly beaten, you can also include the yolks if you want)
<br>•	1 scallion (chopped)
<br>•	1 tablespoon cilantro (chopped, optional)
<br>•	Freshly ground black pepper (optional)



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Marinate the chicken with 1 tablespoon of water, 1 teaspoon cornstarch, and 1 teaspoon oyster sauce. Mix until the liquid is absorbed into the chicken. Set aside.
<br>2.	Finely mince ½ cup of the corn kernels and set aside. Add the chicken stock, minced and whole corn kernels, and turmeric powder to a pot and bring to a low boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes.
<br>3.	Next, add the sesame oil, salt, and white pepper. Turn up the heat slightly. Add the chicken to the soup, and use a spoon to break up any clumps of chicken while stirring for one minute.
<br>4.	Re-mix the cornstarch and chicken stock slurry until incorporated (since the cornstarch and water will separate when left to sit for more than a few minutes). Use a spoon or a whisk to stir the soup while slowly pouring in the cornstarch slurry. The soup will begin to thicken further as the cornstarch cooks. Keep stirring for another 30 seconds. If the soup is too thick, add more stock, and if it’s too thin, add more cornstarch slurry until the soup is at your preferred consistency.
<br>5.	Next, use a large spoon or ladle to gently stir the soup in one direction, while slowly pouring the beaten egg whites into the soup. Stirring slowly in a large slow circular motion will yield large “ribbons” of egg and stirring faster will result in a finer “egg flower.” Again, use your own discretion on how you personally like the texture of the egg!
<br>6.	Stir in half of the scallions, and add the rest as a garnish for serving. If you’re looking for a bit more flavor, you can also drizzle a bit of sesame oil over the top and sprinkle some chopped cilantro and fresh ground black pepper over each bowl.

<h2 style="font-family:courier,arial,helvetica; color:#EDE7E7; margin-left: 80px; margin-right: 150px; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);">SHEPHERD’S PURSE TOFU SOUP RECIPE
<br><br>
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	8 ounces frozen Shepherd’s purse
<br>•	(225g; can substitute frozen spinach)
<br>•	½ block silken tofu (about 7 ounces, 200g)
<br>•	4 cups homemade chicken stock
<br>•	1 1/2 teaspoons salt (or to taste)
<br>•	1 teaspoon sesame oil
<br>•	¼ teaspoon ground white pepper (or to taste)
<br>•	1/4 cup cornstarch (mixed with ¼ cup water)
<br>•	3 egg whites



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Prepare the shepherd’s purse by thawing it out in a colander. When it’s completely thawed, use your hands to gently squeeze the water from it. Chop the leaves into small pieces. Set aside.
<br>2.	Prepare, the silken tofu by cutting it into ½-inch cubes. Set aside. It can be tricky to keep them in a cube shape since the silken tofu is delicate, so don’t worry if they aren’t perfect.
<br>3.	Heat the chicken stock in a medium pot or wok. Add the salt, sesame oil, and ground white pepper. Let everything come to a slow simmer.
<br>4.	Stir up your cornstarch and water mixture since the cornstarch settles at the bottom of the bowl when left standing. Turn the heat down, and use your metal hoak or soup ladle to stir the soup in a circular motion so the soup is moving and swirling. Slowly drizzle all of the cornstarch slurry into the soup while stirring. The trick to thickening the soup with cornstarch is to turn the heat down slightly and keep the soup moving so the cornstarch does not form clumps.
<br>5.	As you continue stirring, turn the heat back up to get the soup to a very low simmer. Check the soup for seasoning and add more salt if needed. Don’t worry if the soup tastes a little saltier than you’d like at this stage, because the Shepherd’s purse and the silken tofu are both unseasoned.
<br>6.	Simmer the soup for a minute, and add the chopped shepherd’s purse. Stir it gently until the leaves are well distributed.
<br>7.	Next, gently add the silken tofu cubes into the soup, and stir, taking care not to break up the tofu. You want to ensure that the tofu and shepherd’s purse are uniformly distributed in the soup and that both are heated evenly. The soup should start to simmer in about 2 to 4 minutes. At this point, you can add a bit more cornstarch slurry if you like a thicker soup, but keep in mind that the soup will thicken more as it cools.
<br>8.	Beat the egg whites briskly for about 10 seconds until the white is broken up and just starts to bubble.
<br>9.	Next, take your ladle or hoak and move it in a wide, steady swirling motion around the perimeter of the pot or wok until the soup is moving. Slowly drizzle the egg white into the soup.
<br>10.	At this point, adjust the heat so the soup is simmering. Taste the soup again, and season to taste with salt, white pepper, and sesame oil if needed. (Sesame oil and especially white pepper enhances the taste of the Shepherd’s purse, so you can add more or simply put these condiments on the table so they can be added as needed.)
<br>11.	Ladle the soup into bowls to serve or pour the soup into a larger family style soup bowl to serve at the table.

 <br><br>
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	1 (3 lbs / 1.3 kg) beef chuck roast , cut into 1.5” (3 cm) chunks
<br>•	1/4 cup Shaoxing wine (or dry sherry)
<br>•	6 dried chili peppers
<br>•	1 thumb ginger , sliced
<br>•	3 green onions , halved crosswise
<br>•	4 bay leaves
<br>•	1 star anise
<br>•	1 cinnamon stick
<br>•	1 tablespoon sugar
<br>•	1/2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
<br>•	1/4 cup light soy sauce (or soy sauce)
<br>•	1 tablespoon dark soy sauce (or soy sauce) (*Footnote 1)
<br>•	1/2 teaspoon salt
<br>•	3 carrots , cut into 2-inch pieces
<br>•	2 medium waxy potatoes (or 1 large russet potato, quartered) 



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Place the beef in a 4-quart (3.78-liter) dutch oven and add 4 cups of cold tap water so the water just covers the beef. Heat the pot over medium-high heat until it reaches a gentle boil. Stir occasionally to prevent the beef from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Turn to medium heat. Let it boil gently for 10 to 15 minutes. While boiling, skim the foam from the top of the broth and discard it until the broth is clear.
<br>2.	Add the Shaoxing wine, chili peppers, ginger, green onion, bay leaves, star anise, cinnamon stick, sugar, and ground black pepper. Turn to medium-low heat. Let simmer, covered, for 40 minutes.
<br>3.	Add the light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and salt. Stir to mix well. Continue simmering uncovered for 1 hour to 1 hour 30 minutes, until the beef turns tender but not to the point of falling apart.
<br>4.	Add the carrots and potatoes. Simmer uncovered for another 30 minutes or so, until the veggies get tender.
<br>5.	Serve hot as a main over steamed rice or boiled noodles.

 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	4 teaspoons vegetable oil
<br>•	3 eggs, beaten
<br>•	1 medium head cabbage, finely shredded
<br>•	½ carrot, julienned
<br>•	1 (8 ounce) can shredded bamboo shoots
<br>•	1 cup dried, shredded wood ear mushroom, rehydrated
<br>•	1 pound Chinese barbequed or roasted pork, cut into matchsticks
<br>•	2 green onions, thinly sliced
<br>•	2 ½ teaspoons soy sauce
<br>•	1 teaspoon salt
<br>•	1 teaspoon sugar
<br>•	½ teaspoon monosodium glutamate (MSG)
<br>•	1 (14 ounce) package egg roll wrappers
<br>•	1 egg white, beaten
<br>•	4 cups oil for frying, or as needed



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Heat 1 teaspoon vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over medium heat. Pour in beaten eggs and cook, without stirring, until firmed. Flip the eggs over and cook for an additional 20 seconds to firm the other side. Set egg pancake aside to cool, then slice into thin strips.
<br>2.	Heat the remaining vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. Stir in cabbage and carrot; cook for 2 minutes to wilt. Add bamboo, mushroom, pork, green onions, soy sauce, salt, sugar, and MSG; continue cooking until the vegetables soften, about 6 minutes. Stir in sliced egg, then spread mixture out onto a pan, and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour.
<br>3.	To assemble the egg rolls, place a wrapper onto your work surface with one corner pointing towards you. Place about 3 tablespoons of cooled filling in a heap onto the bottom third of the wrapper. Brush a little beaten egg white onto the top two edges of the wrapper, then fold the bottom corner over the filling and roll firmly to the halfway point. Fold the left and right sides snugly over the egg roll, then continue rolling until the top corners seal the egg roll with the egg white. Repeat with remaining egg roll wrappers, covering finished egg rolls with plastic wrap to keep from drying out.
<br>4.	Heat about 6-inches of oil in a wok or deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
<br>5.	Fry egg rolls 3 or 4 at a time until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain on paper towels.

 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients
 
<br>•	1 lb boneless, skinless chicken thighs (at room temperature)
<br>•	9 green onions/scallions
<br>•	neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
<br>•	Yakitori Sauce (Tare):
<br>•	½ cup soy sauce
<br>•	½ cup mirin
<br>•	¼ cup sake
<br>•	¼ cup water
<br>•	2 tsp brown sugar (pack tighly and level off)



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Gather all the ingredients.  Soak about 10 to 12 (5-inch) bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.
<br>To Make Yakitori Sauce (Tare)
<br>3.	In a small saucepan, add mirin, soy sauce, sake, water, brown sugar, and the green part of 1 scallion, and bring it to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer, uncovered, until the liquid is reduced by half. It will take about 30 minutes. The sauce will thicken with a glossy shine. Let it cool to room temperature before using. Reserve ⅓ of the sauce in a small bowl for final coating (Use this sauce after the chicken is cooked). Note: You can make the sauce ahead of time. Put only the sauce (no green onion) in a mason jar. Store in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 months in the refrigerator.
<br>To Prepare Yakitori
<br>4.	Cut the white and light green part of scallions into 1 inch (2.5 cm) pieces. Cut chicken into 1-inch (2.5 cm) cubes. On a flat work surface, fold each slice of chicken in half, insert into the chicken at 45 degrees angle, and press down on the skewer to pierce through the center.
<br>5.	Alternate each chicken slice with a piece of scallion lined up perpendicular to the skewer. Each skewer will hold about 4 chicken slices and 3 scallion pieces.
<br>To Grill (Broil) Yakitori
<br>6.	Grease the grate of the broiler/wire rack (or oven-safe cooling rack) to avoid the chicken sticking on the grate. Place the skewers on top. Set the broiler to high and wait until the heating elements are hot. Broil for 6 minutes.
<br>7.	Take out 2 Tbsp of the Yakitori Sauce in a small bowl for brushing (you do not want to cross contaminate). After 6 minutes, brush the sauce on the meat on both sides and continue to broil for 3-4 minutes to caramelize the sauce. Transfer the skewers to a serving plate. Using a clean brush, brush the chicken on top with the reserved sauce. Tip: If you accidentally cross-contaminate (Dip the brush you used for coating the raw chicken in the sauce), you have to boil the sauce again. Serve and enjoy!

<br>2.	Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Fill a broiler tray with enough water to cover the bottom. Place the grate or rack over the tray. Arrange the ribs on the grate.
<br>3.	Place the broiler rack in the center of the oven. Cook for 40 minutes, turning and brushing with the marinade every 10 minutes. Let the marinade cook on for the final 10 minutes to make a glaze. Finish under the broiler if desired. Discard any remaining marinade.

 <br><br>
 
 Ingredients

<br>•	1 (1-pound) pork tenderloin, trimmed
<br>•	¼ cup low-sodium soy sauce
<br>•	2 tablespoons light brown sugar
<br>•	1 tablespoon reduced-fat creamy peanut butter
<br>•	1 tablespoon fresh lime juice
<br>•	2 garlic cloves, minced
<br>•	¼ cup chopped green onions
<br>•	18 (6-inch) wooden skewers
<br>•	Cooking spray
<br>•	Peanut Dipping Sauce



<br><br>

<br>Instructions
<br>1.	Cut pork tenderloin in half lengthwise. Place plastic wrap over tenderloin halves; pound to 1/4-inch thickness using a meat mallet or small, heavy skillet. Cut each tenderloin half diagonally across the grain into 1-inch strips. Place strips in a large zip-top plastic bag.
<br>2.	Combine soy sauce and next 5 ingredients in a small bowl; stir with a whisk until well blended. Pour over tenderloin strips in bag, tossing to coat, and seal bag. Marinate in refrigerator at least 1 hour, turning bag occasionally.
<br>3.	While tenderloin marinates, soak skewers in water 30 minutes. Preheat broiler.
<br>4.	Remove tenderloin strips from bag; discard marinade. Thread 1 strip onto each skewer. Place skewers on a broiler rack coated with cooking spray; broil 3 minutes on each side or until done. Serve with Peanut Dipping Sauce.
