<br>20 mins
<br>Cook Time
<br>10 mins
<br>Total Time
<br>30 mins<br><br>


Ingredients
<br>
<br>• 	4 leaves red leaf lettuce
<br>•	1 bunch mint
<br>•	1 bunch cilantro
<br>•	¾ lb thinly sliced short rib
<br>•	1-2 carrot
<br>•	1-2 cucumber
<br>•	1 green onion/scallion
<br>•	1 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)
<br>•	8 rice papers<br><br>
Yakiniku Sauce (Tare)
<br>•	½ cup gluten-free soy sauce (I used Kikkoman Gluten-Free Tamari Soy Sauce)
<br>•	3 Tbsp sugar
<br>•	2 Tbsp mirin
<br>•	2 Tbsp sake
<br>•	1 Tbsp sesame seeds
<br>•	½ tsp gochugaru (Korean pepper flakes) (or use ichimi togarashi)
<br>•	½ tsp sesame oil (roasted)
<br>•	freshly ground black pepper
<br>•	½ clove garlic
<br>•	½ knob ginger
<br>•	¼ apple (I used Fuji apple)<br><br>

Directions
<br><br>1.	Rinse the lettuce, mint, and cilantro and dry completely. Gather all the ingredients on the working surface.
<br><br>2.	Add all the ingredients for the sauce: ½ cup soy sauce, 3 Tbsp granulated sugar, 2 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, 1 Tbsp sesame seeds, ½ tsp gochugaru (or ichimi togarashi), ½ tsp sesame oil, and freshly ground black pepper.
<br><br>3.	Grate ¼ apple, ½ clove garlic, and ½ knob ginger and add the grated apple, garlic, and ginger into the sauce and mix all together.
<br><br>4.	Place the meat in a single layer and drizzle some of the sauce on top. The sauce does not have to cover the entire meat. In Japanese BBQ restaurants, they usually just drizzle a small amount to the meat. 
<br><br>5.	Peel the carrot. Use a julienne peeler or a knife to cut the carrot into julienned strips.
<br><br>6.	Cut the cucumber diagonally into thin slices and then cut them into thin strips.
<br><br>7.	Cut off the green part of the green onions and we will only use the white part. Cut the white part in half lengthwise and thinly slice into long strips. Soak in iced water to make them crisp and curl.
<br><br>8.	Heat the griddle or frying pan or outdoor grill and brush the oil on the griddle. When it’s hot, start cooking the meat. Once you get nice char on one side, flip and cook the other side. Cooking time varies depends on the meat and its thickness. Set aside.
<br><br>9.	Once all the food is prepared, pour hot water into a large bowl. Working with 1 wrapper at a time, soak the wrapper in the hot water and rotate 2-3 times, about 5 seconds. The wrapper will still feel slightly stiff but don’t worry, it will become softer. Place it flat on a plate.
<br><br>10.	Lay the lettuce, carrot, cucumber, white part of green onion, and grilled meat at bottom 1/3 of the rice paper.
<br><br>11.	Pick up the bottom of the rice paper and press firmly down to hold the filling in place. Roll tightly once.
<br><br>12.	Around the middle of the rice paper, fold both sides into the center and roll up tightly 1-2 times.
<br><br>13.	Right before finish rolling, place the mint and cilantro leaves on the rice paper and finish rolling up. This way, you can see through the mint and cilantro. Set aside and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Repeat with the remaining rice papers and fillings.
<br><br>14.	Cut in half or in thirds, and serve with the Yakiniku Sauce.

<br>Course: Appetizer, Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: chicken karaage, fried chicken
<br>Servings: 2
<br>Author: Namiko Chen
<br>Prep Time
<br>15 mins
<br>Cook Time
<br>15 mins
<br>Marinating Time
<br>30 mins
<br>Total Time
<br>1 hr
<br><br>


Ingredients
<br>
<br>•	1.1 lb boneless, skin-on chicken thighs
<br>•	kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)
<br>•	freshly ground black pepper
<br>•	4 Tbsp potato starch/cornstarch
<br>•	1 Tbsp rice flour
<br>•	2 ½ cup neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc)<br><br>
<br>For Marinade
<br>•	1 knob ginger (1", 2.5 cm)
<br>•	1 clove garlic
<br>•	2 Tbsp sake
<br>•	2 Tbsp gluten-free soy sauce<br><br>
<br>For garnish
<br>•	lemon wedges
<br>•	parsley (optional)
<br>•	lettuce (optional - I used butter lettuce)
<br>•	shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) (optional - for spicy kick)
<br>•	Japanese mayonnaise (optional - for dipping)
<br><br>

Directions
<br><br>1.	Gather all the ingredients.
<br><br>2.	Peel and grate ginger and crush (or mince) the garlic. In a large bowl, whisk all the ingredients for the marinade.
<br><br>3.	Cut each skin-on chicken thigh into 5 to 6 pieces, about 1 ½ inch pieces and lightly season the chicken with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
<br><br>4.	Add the chicken to the marinade. Coat and rub the chicken with marinade using your hands/tongs. Set aside for 30 to 60 minutes.
<br><br>5.	In a medium bowl, combine potato starch and rice flour and whisk well.
<br><br>6.	In a pot, heat the oil to 340ºF (170ºC). I use a smaller 1 ½ QT pot, so that oil is deep enough, and I don't have to use much oil. Use a thermometer or wooden chopsticks to see if the oil is ready.
<br><br>7.	When the oil is hot, drain the chicken well from the marinade and coat each piece with the flour mixture.
<br><br>8.	Deep fry for 90 seconds, or until the chicken is light golden color. Work with a few pieces at a time, so the oil temperature won’t drop quickly. I worked with 3 to 4 pieces at a time.
<br><br>9.	Transfer the chicken to a wire rack to drain excess oil. Let the chicken cook with the remaining heat while you work on the rest of the chicken.
<br><br>10.	Once the chicken is all deep-fried for the first round, use a fine-mesh sieve to pick up crumbs to keep the oil clean. If you don't do this step, the crumbs get darker, and then the oil gets darker.
<br><br>11.	Increase the heat and bring the oil to 350ºF (180ºC). Deep fry the chicken for the second time for 45 seconds or until crispy and golden brown. Transfer the chicken to a wire rack to drain excess oil.
<br><br>12.	Serve the chicken immediately with lemon wedges, parsley, lettuce, and shichimi togarashi. If you like, squeeze the lemon before you eat and sprinkle shichimi togarashi for spice.

<br>Ready for a summer cookout?  I highly recommend giving this Tsukune recipe a try. Drizzled with sweet soy sauce, these Japanese chicken meatball skewers are absolutely delicious. They are best on the grill but you can bake them in the oven too. 
<br>Course: Appetizer, Main Course
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: chicken meatball, yakitori
<br>Servings: 14 skewers
<br>Author: Namiko Chen
<br>Prep Time
<br>40 mins
<br>Cook Time
<br>11 mins
<br>Total Time
<br>51 mins
<br><br>


Ingredients
<br>
<br>•	1 lb ground chicken
<br>•	1 Tbsp sesame oil (roasted) (and more for coating your hands)
<br>•	1 Tbsp miso (I use koji miso or awase miso, which is a combination of red and white miso)
<br>•	10 shiso leaves (perilla/ooba)
<br>•	4 green onions/scallions
<br>•	kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)
<br>•	½ cup yakitori tare (sauce)<br><br>
<br>Toppings:
<br>•	shichimi togarashi (Japanese seven spice) (for a spicy kick)

<br><br>

Directions
<br><br>1.	Gather all the ingredients. Make the yakitori sauce first and soak 14 5-inch flat bamboo skewers in water for 30 minutes.
<br><br>2.	Pile and roll up the shiso leaves, then cut into thin julienne slices. Cut the scallion into thin slices.
<br><br>3.	Heat a non-stick frying pan over medium heat. When it’s hot, add ⅓ of ground chicken and break it up into small pieces using a wooden spatula. Cook until no longer pink and transfer to a plate to let it cool.
<br><br>4.	Combine the cooked chicken and uncooked chicken in a large bowl and mix well with a rubber spatula.
<br><br>5.	Add sesame oil and miso and mix well and add the scallions and shiso leaves and combine well with a silicone spatula.
<br><br>6.	Now with your hand, knead 30 times clockwise. Then knead counterclockwise 30 times. The meat will become paler in color and sticky. This part is very important for the meat to stay on a stick so please do not skip this step.
<br><br>7.	Grease the grill rack with a brush. I use a roasting pan and rack as it can support the skewers very well while the excess oil drips down to the bottom of the roasting pan when cooking.
<br><br>8.	Lightly coat your hands with sesame oil to prevent the meat from sticking. Scoop a handful of the chicken mixture (1 ½ scoop using a cookie scoop) and form into a round patty.
<br><br>9.	Toss the meat to left and right hands to release the air pockets and gently squeeze to form the meat into a long oval patty, about 3-4 inches in length. Insert the skewer on the prepared wire rack.
<br><br>10.	Lightly sprinkle salt over the chicken skewers and put aluminum foil around the skewers to prevent them from burning.
<br><br>11.	Set the oven broiler to high (550ºF/288 ºC) for 5 minutes before cooking. Place the baking sheet in the middle rack of the oven, about 8" (20 cm) away from the heating element. Cook for 6 minutes, and then flip to cook the other side for another 4 minutes. Watch the chicken carefully not to burn; if your oven is small/strong, try broiling at medium (500ºF/260ºC) or lower the rack.
<br><br>12.	When both sides are cooked, brush the yakitori sauce on the meat and broil for another 30 seconds. Transfer the skewers to a serving plate and brush the extra sauce on the meat. Serve with Shichimi Togarashi.

<br>Deep-fried to golden brown deliciousness, these Shrimp Egg Rolls are a great appetizer to start your meal or a weekend party. Dip in a leek and miso sauce (Negi Miso) to enjoy! 
<br>Course: Appetizer
<br>Cuisine: Japanese
<br>Keyword: egg roll, shrimp
<br>Servings: 10 egg rolls
<br>Author: Namiko Chen
<br>Prep Time
<br>30 mins
<br>Cook Time
<br>15 mins
<br>Total Time
<br>45 mins
<br><br>


Ingredients
<br>
<br>•	½ lb shrimp (roughly 10 shrimp)
<br>•	1 Tbsp sake
<br>•	⅛ tsp kosher/sea salt (I use Diamond Crystal; Use half for table salt)
<br>•	1 knob ginger (1", 2.5 cm)
<br>•	1 negi (long green onion)
<br>•	5 egg roll wrappers
<br>•	4 Tbsp Negi Miso
<br>•	¾ cup neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, canola, etc) (for deep frying)<br><br>
<br>Flour mixture “glue”
<br>•	1 tsp all-purpose flour (plain flour)
<br>•	1 tsp water

<br><br>

Directions
<br><br>1.	Pull off the head if it is still attached. Pull off the outer shell. Devein the back of shrimp with a skewer. The vein runs right along the back. Insert the tip of skewer sideways about ½ inch down from the head of the shrimp and pull the skewer tip up towards you. This will lift up the vein and you can pull off the vein with the skewer or with your hand. If the vein is broken, then insert again a bit lower towards the tail. If you can’t find the vein, then don’t worry about it. [Recommended] Clean the shrimp with a pinch of salt, 1 Tbsp potato/corn starch, and 2 Tbsp water in a bowl and rub until you see dirty water. Rinse until clean.
<br><br>2.	Cut the tip of the tail diagonally.
<br><br>3.	Remove dirty water in the tail by holding the tip of the knife down on the tail and moving it from left to right squeezing the water out from the cut tip. If you skip this process, water retained in the tail might create splatter in the oil.
<br><br>4.	Now all the tail is almost translucent and make a couple of slits diagonally underside of the shrimp.
<br><br>5.	Hold the shrimp with both hands and straighten it as much as possible in order to get the desired shape.
<br><br>6.	In a small bowl, put the shrimp, sake, and salt and mix well together. Let it marinate until you’re ready to use them.
<br><br>7.	Peel the ginger skin and cut it into julienned strips and cut the negi diagonally into thin slices.
<br><br>8.	Cut the egg roll wrappers in half and peel off one egg roll at a time to separate them (now you have 10 wrappers!).
<br><br>9.	Prepare the flour mixture by mixing flour and water in a small bowl. Put the Negi Miso in a small bowl.
<br><br>10.	Place an egg roll wrapper in front of you with one point of the long side of the wrapper towards you. Place the Negi Miso and shrimp (tail sticking out ½ of the way onto the wrapper on the long side.
<br><br>11.	Put julienned ginger and negi on the shrimp. Fold bottom edge of the wrapper over the shrimp.
<br><br>12.	Fold the side edge over to meet the shrimp, and begin to roll.
<br><br>13.	Continue rolling until you meet the end of the wrapper. Place a small dollop of the flour mixture on the edge of the wrapper. Repeat wrapping until all shrimp and wraps are done.
<br><br>14.	In a large frying pan or medium saucepan, place ½ inch of oil. Heat on medium heat until hot and begins to have tiny bubbles when a chopstick tip is placed in the oil.
<br><br>15.	Slowly place egg rolls in the pan. Do not crowd. Cover with the splatter guard if you have one. Cook until golden brown and shrimp is fully cooked. About 3 minutes on each side.
<br><br>16.	Remove from pan and place on paper towel to catch any excess oil. Serve with Negi Miso.
